## Overview

The Procedural Art Generator lets you create stunning generative art using mathematical algorithms. It's designed to be accessible to everyone - no programming knowledge required. Simply adjust parameters and watch as intricate patterns come to life.

## Features

- **12 Different Algorithms**: From particle systems to flow fields and chaotic attractors
- **Interactive Controls**: Adjust parameters in real-time and see immediate results
- **Color Customization**: Choose your own color schemes or use random/harmonic generators
- **Gallery System**: Save your favorite creations to a personal gallery
- **Direct Image Download**: Export your artwork as high-quality PNG files
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices
